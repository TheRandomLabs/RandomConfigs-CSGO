# RandomConfigs-CSGO

My configs for Counter-Strike: Global Offensive.

## Installation

* Copy `randomconfigs` to your CS:GO `cfg` directory. This is
`C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\Counter-Strike Global Offensive\csgo\cfg`
by default on Windows.
* Modify the configs in `personal` before changing anything else. These configs change properties
like sensitivity, volume, etc.
* Copying `autoexec.cfg` is not required as long as you have `exec randomconfigs/main` somewhere
in your autoexec.
* `install.bat` copies `randomconfigs` and `autoexec.cfg` to the default Windows CS:GO `cfg`
directory.
